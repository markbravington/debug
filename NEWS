1.4.13
 - Added 'partial_parse_OK' argument to 'mrun/mdrun', and convenient wrapper 'mpdrun' eg for scriptlets that aren't intended to parse cleanly anyway.

1.4.0
 - By default, disabled non-interactive consolette setup (which used to happen during '.onLoad'), because consolette does not seem to be working at all in R4.4, and was breaking R CMD check etc. Not sure when R changed. Consolette needs more work...

1.3.195
 - 'mdrunex' for package examples; thus needed to add 'utils' to "Imports"

1.3.191
 - Fixed handling of 'mvbutils::local.return', which got broken by (...I think...) changes in R itself circa 4.1 

1.3.185
 - Slightly better 'debug_knitr' and its documentation

1.3.156
 - Better deparsing of ':=' and '?', thanks to 'mvbutils::mdeparse'

1.3.155
 - 'debug_BROWSE()' function offers 'browser()'-like functionality, when you don't want to fully 'mtrace()' a function.

1.3.150
 - Support for debugging vignette code (at least via 'knitr' and Lyx). Currently easiest with raw-string support in R4.0+

1.3.148
 - Option to change current-line background is 'debug.execline'; previously mis-documented in 'package?debug'.

1.3.42
 - Added support for 'mvbutils::FOR' and 'mvbutils::do.on': eg can now step into 'FOR( objects, { c( head( ., 1), tail( ., 1)})'.
