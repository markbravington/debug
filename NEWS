2020/4: Created this list!

2020/4: (v1.3.42) Added support for 'mvbutils::FOR' and 'mvbutils::do.on': eg can now step into 'FOR( objects, { c( head( ., 1), tail( ., 1)})'.

2020/4: Option to change current-line background is 'debug.execline'; previously mis-documented in 'package?debug'.

2020/4: Support for debugging vignette code (at least via 'knitr' and Lyx). Currently easiest with raw-string support in R4.0+

2021/12, 1.3.155: 'debug_BROWSE()' function offers 'browser()'-like functionality, when you don't want to fully 'mtrace()' a function.

2022/1, 1.3.156: Better deparsing of ':=' and '?', thanks to 'mvbutils::mdeparse'

2022/8, 1.3.185: Slightly better 'debug_knitr' and its documentation

2023/7, 1.3.191: Fixed handling of 'mvbutils::local.return', which got broken by (...I think...) changes in R itself circa 4.1 

2024/6, 1.3.195: 'mdrunex' for package examples; thus needed to add 'utils' to "Imports"

2024/7, 1.4.0: By default, disabled non-interactive consolette setup (which used to happen during '.onLoad'), because consolette does not seem to be working at all in R4.4, and was breaking R CMD check etc. Not sure when R changed. Consolette needs more work...
